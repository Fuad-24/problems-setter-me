										FITU
	Titu is bored so he decided to play with two glasses infront of him glass A and Glass B.
In this game he memorizes the amount of water in glass B and pours all the water in glass B from A.Then 
he fills glass A with the memomorized amount of water. He repeats this procedure again and again. Assume
that tha glasses has ifinite capacity and at the begining two glasses has same amount (b unit) of water 
in them. You are given an integer n (how many times he repeated the procedure). You have to find the 
amount of water in glass B after n times.

Input:
First line of input contains an integet t number of test cases and the following t lines contains two 
integers n and b number of repitation and initial amoun of water in both glasses.
0<t<=100000000,
0<=n<=50,
0<=b<=10000000.

Output:
Out put contains t lines in ith line (0<i<=t) there will be an integer showing the amount of water
in B glass after nthe iopperation of i th test case.
